                When enabled, any words beginning with a capital letter are ignored (i.e., are
                skipped over without being checked). You might enable this option if the text
                being checked contains many proper names. </p>

            <p class="spellex"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore All-Caps Words</span>: When enabled, any
                words containing all capital letters are ignored (i.e., are skipped without
                being checked). You might enable this option if the text being checked contains
                many acronyms.

            <p class="spellex"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore Words with Numbers</span>: When enabled,
                any words containing embedded digits are ignored (i.e., are skipped without
                being checked). Examples of such words include <I>Win98</I> and <I>Q4</I>. You
                might enable this option if the text being checked contains many code words
                or other symbols containing digits.

            <p class="spellex"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore Words with Mixed Case</span>: When enabled,
                any words containing an unusual mixture of upper- and lower-case letters are
                ignored (i.e., are skipped without being checked). Examples of such words include
                <I>MicroHouse</I> and <I>CapsLock</I>. You might enable this option if the text
                being checked contains many variable names or other symbols which use case changes
                to distinguish words.

                that appear to be Internet domain names (such as <I>spellex.com</I>) are ignored
                (i.e., are skipped without being checked).

                misspelled words resulting from incorrect capitalization (such as <I>canada</I>
                instead of <I>Canada</I>) are reported as capitalization errors.

                spelling checker reports the same word appearing twice in a row.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p class="spellex"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Case Sensitive</span>: When enabled, a distinction
                is made between capitalized and non-capitalized words. For example, <I>canada</I>
                is considered different from <I>Canada</I>, so <I>canada</I> would be reported
                as a misspelling. When the option is disabled, <I>canada</I>, <I>Canada</I>,
                and <I>CANADA</I> are considered identical. Note that the performance of the
                spelling checker will be reduced if this option is disabled.

                words will be suggested as a replacement for a misspelling containing two joined
                words. For example, <I>is the</I> would be suggested as a replacement for <I>isthe</I>.
